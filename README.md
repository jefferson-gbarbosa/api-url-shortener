# Project Title:

URL Shortener With FastAPI 


## 1. What is the project?

The need to have an application to shorten links, and thus complete my Frontend Mentor challenge, made me start studying how to build APIs using Python.In this RealPython tutorial, we build a fully functional Python web application based on FastAPI that creates shortened URLs that forward to destination URLs. URLs can be extremely long and difficult to use. This is where a URL shortener can come in handy. A URL shortener reduces the number of characters in a URL, making it easier to read, remember, and share.

## 2. Tech Stack:

- Swagger UI
- Python 3
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy
- Uvicorn server

## 3. Project Dependencies:

 - Installation(s)
```
(venv) $ python -m pip install fastapi==0.75.0 uvicorn==0.17.6
(venv) $ python -m pip install sqlalchemy==1.4.32
(venv) $ python -m pip install python-dotenv==0.19.2
(venv) $ python -m pip install validators==0.18.2
```

- .env file

```
ENV_NAME="XXXXXXXX"
BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:XXXX"
DB_URL="sqlite:///./XXXXXXXXXX.db"
```


## 4. Installing:

i. Clone the git repo

```
https://github.com/jefferson-gbarbosa/url-shortener
```

ii. Open project folder

iii. Explore

ðŸ˜Ž


## 5. How To Use:

i. Open project in preferred IDE. I'm using VS Code.

ii. Run the live server using uvicorn.

```commandline
(venv) $ uvicorn shortener_app.main:app --reload
```

- Create SQLite database

> When the server restarted, sqlalchemy automatically created your database in the location that you defined in your DB_URL environment variable. If you used sqlite:///./shortener.db as the value of DB_URL, then there should be a file named shortener.db in the root directory of your project now. Thatâ€™s your SQLite database!

iii. Open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" in any web browser
